## General Info
When you run the code, the app will prompt you to enter an initial board to solve. You can type them in manually or paste them in. 
ðŸ‘‡ Try the examples below: ðŸ‘‡

```cpp

```cpp

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

```
All zeros will be considered empty spaces and the current puzzle will print to screen  like so: <br>
![Start State](https://i.ibb.co/RDzxw67/Sudoku-AI-Console-App-Start-State.png)

At this point the AI will start and solve the board if it's solvable. Once finished, the program will display the board with the empty spaces filled. <br>
![Solved State](https://i.ibb.co/F67txvQ/Sudoku-AI-Console-App-Solved-State.png)

If the board is impossible to solve, then an error message ``Error: Board is unsolvable`` will be shown.
